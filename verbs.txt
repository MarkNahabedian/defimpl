append            appends the specified values to the field.

delegate          the method will delegate to another object.

delete            deletes the specified item from the filed.

discriminate      the empty method that distinguishes implementors of
                  this interface from those that would otherwise have
                  the same method set.

embed             Specifies a concrete type to embed to implement an
                  interface.

index             returns the element of the specified slice valued
                  field at the specified (zero based) index.

iterate           applies the specified function to each element of
                  the  slice-valued slot until the function returns
                  false.

length            returns the length of the specified slice valued field.

panic             the method will panic if called, for when an
                  implementation only needs to partially implement an
                  interface.
                  
read              returns the value of the field.

set               sets the value of the field to that provided.
